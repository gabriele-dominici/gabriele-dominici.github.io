I have just started a PhD in Explainable AI for Healthcare at the Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI). During the following years, I will design Deep Learning models explainable by design, exploring causal models and counterfactuals. Here, I am supervised by [Prof Marc Langheinrich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y6ztFvsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr Martin Gjoreski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=b6NoAQMAAAAJ) and [Dr Pietro Barbiero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4gbToQoAAAAJ). <br>
Last summer, I graduated from the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. There, I have done research in NLP, Graph Neural Network, Explainable AI and Multimodal learning. There I was supervised by [Prof Pietro Liò](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4YhNJBEAAAAJ&hl), [Dr Nikola Simidjievski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T5l2R6IAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr Pietro Barbiero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4gbToQoAAAAJ) and [Charlotte Magister](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=do6o-rYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Over last years, I have worked as a Research Intern at MIT, being selected as one of the 30 students in the SGI program. There, I have worked in project at the intersection between Geometric Processing and Deep Learning, supervised by [Dr Peter Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9TX3RmEAAAAJ), [Dr Alberto Tono](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TNHkbL0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Silvia Sellàn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4FeC1wQAAAAJ) and [Tongzhou Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=14HASnUAAAAJ).

Previously, I have also work for an year as a Machine Learning Engineer for Reply. There, I focused on developing ML models to maximize revenue and subscription, reducing customer churn for one of the biggest telecom companies.
